        "\n",
        "1. What is Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)?\n",
        " - Object-oriented programming (OOP) is a programming style that organizes software around objects, rather than logic and functions. OOP is based on the idea that objects can contain data and perform actions.\n",
        "2. What is a class in OOP.\n",
        " - In object-oriented programming (OOP), a class is a blueprint for creating objects. Classes define the shared characteristics of objects, such as their variables and methods.  \n",
        "3. What is an object in OOP.\n",
        " - In object-oriented programming (OOP), an object is a unit of code that represents a real-world entity, such as a person or a car. Objects are the basic building blocks of OOP programs.\n",
        "4. What is the difference between abstraction and encapsulation.\n",
        " - Abstraction hides unnecessary details while encapsulation controls access to data. Abstraction is a design-level process, while encapsulation involves implementation.\n",
        "5. What are dunder methods in Python.\n",
        " - Python dunder methods are the special predefined methods having two prefixes and two suffix underscores in the method name. Here, the word dunder means double under (underscore).\n",
        "6. Explain the concept of inheritance in OOP.\n",
        " - In object-oriented programming (OOP), inheritance is a mechanism that allows a class to inherit properties and behaviors from another class. This creates a hierarchy of classes, with the inherited class being called a subclass and the class it inherits from being called a superclass.\n",
        "7.  What is polymorphism in OOP.\n",
        " - In Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), polymorphism means \"many forms\" and allows objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common type, enabling flexible and reusable code.\n",
        "8.  How is encapsulation achieved in Python.\n",
        " - Encapsulation is achieved by declaring a class's data members and methods as either private or protected. But in Python, we do not have keywords like public, private, and protected, as in the case of Java. Instead, we achieve this by using single and double underscores.\n",
        "9. What is a constructor in Python.\n",
        " - In Python, a constructor is a special method called when an object is created. Its purpose is to assign values to the data members within the class when an object is initialized. The name of the constructor method is always __init__.\n",
        "10. What are class and static methods in Python.\n",
        " - A class method can access or modify the class state while a static method can't access or modify it. In general, static methods know nothing about the class state. They are utility-type methods that take some parameters and work upon those parameters. On the other hand class methods must have class as a parameter.\n",
        "11. What is method overloading in Python.\n",
        " -  Method Overloading is a fundamental concept in OOP that enables a class to define multiple methods with the same name but different parameters. In Python, this powerful feature allows developers to create versatile functions capable of handling various data types.\n",
        "12. What is method overriding in OOP.\n",
        " - Method overriding, in object-oriented programming, is a language feature that allows a subclass or child class to provide a specific implementation of a method that is already provided by one of its superclasses or parent classes.\n",
        "13. What is a property decorator in Python.\n",
        " - The Python property decorator makes attributes in a class act like read-only properties. Essentially, it lets you access methods as if they were attributes, without needing to write parentheses.\n",
        "14. Why is polymorphism important in OOP.\n",
        " - Polymorphism is crucial in Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) because it enables code reusability, flexibility, and extensibility by allowing different objects to respond to the same method call in their own unique ways, promoting a more adaptable and maintainable codebase.\n",
        "15. What is an abstract class in Python.\n",
        " - An abstract class in Python is a class that cannot be instantiated directly. Instead, it serves as a blueprint for other classes. Abstract classes allow you to define methods that must be created within any child class built from the abstract class.\n",
        "16. What are the advantages of OOP.\n",
        " - The primary advantages of using Object-Oriented Programming? The main advantages of OOP include improved code organization through encapsulation, reusability via inheritance, flexibility with polymorphism, and simplification of complex systems through abstraction.\n",
        "17. What is the difference between a class variable and an instance variable.\n",
        " - Class variables are defined within the class but outside of any class methods. Instance variables are defined within class methods, typically the constructor. Changes made to the class variable affect all instances. Changes made to the instance variable does not affect all instances.\n",
        "18. What is multiple inheritance in Python.\n",
        " - Multiple inheritance in Python is a feature that allows a class to inherit attributes and methods from more than one parent class. This enables the creation of classes that combine behaviors from multiple sources. When a class inherits from multiple parent classes, it gains access to the attributes and methods of all those parent classes.\n",
        "19. Explain the purpose of ‘’__str__’ and ‘__repr__’ ‘ methods in Python.\n",
        "  - * __str__:\n",
        "This method aims to return a user-friendly, informal string representation of an object. It is called when using the str() function or when the print() function is used on an object. If __str__ is not defined, Python falls back to using __repr__ if it is available. The primary goal of __str__ is readability for end users.\n",
        "  - * __repr__:\n",
        "This method should return an unambiguous, formal string representation of an object, often including details that can be used to recreate the object. It is called when using the repr() function or when an object is displayed in the interactive Python interpreter. __repr__ is primarily intended for debugging and development, providing developers with detailed information about the object's state.\n",
        "20.  What is the significance of the ‘super()’ function in Python.\n",
        " - The super() function in Python is used to call methods from a parent class within a child class. It plays a crucial role in inheritance, allowing for code reuse and extension of functionality. Its primary significance lies in enabling a clean and maintainable way to interact with parent classes, especially in complex inheritance scenarios.\n",
        "21. What is the significance of the __del__ method in Python.\n",
        " - The __del__ method, also known as a destructor, in Python is called when an object is about to be destroyed. It provides an opportunity to perform cleanup actions, such as releasing external resources held by the object like file descriptors, network connections, or releasing locks. However, the timing of when __del__ is called is not guaranteed, as it depends on the garbage collector. Therefore, relying on __del__ for critical resource management is not recommended. It is better to use context managers or explicit close() methods for resource management.\n",
        "22. What is the difference between @staticmethod and @classmethod in python.\n",
        " - The main difference between @staticmethod and @classmethod in Python lies in their interaction with the class and its instances:\n",
        " - * @staticmethod:\n",
        "This decorator defines a method that is independent of the class and its instances. It doesn't receive any implicit arguments like self or cls. It behaves like a regular function but is namespaced within the class. It cannot access or modify the class state.\n",
        " - * @classmethod:\n",
        "This decorator defines a method that is bound to the class, not the instance. It receives the class itself as the first argument, conventionally named cls. It can access and modify the class state but cannot access instance-specific attributes.\n",
        "23. How does polymorphism work in Python with inheritance.\n",
        " - Polymorphism in Python, specifically when used with inheritance, allows objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common type. This is achieved through method overriding. When a child class inherits from a parent class, it can redefine methods of the parent class. This redefinition is known as method overriding. When a method is called on an object, Python checks the object's class for the method. If the method is found in the object's class, it is executed. If not, Python searches for the method in the parent class and so on up the inheritance hierarchy.\n",
        "24. What is method chaining in Python OOP.\n",
        " - Method chaining in Python OOP is a technique of calling multiple methods sequentially on the same object in a single line of code. It works by having each method return the object instance (self) after performing its operation. This allows subsequent methods to be called on the result of the previous method, creating a chain of actions.\n",
        "For method chaining to work, each method in the chain must return self, which refers to the current instance of the class. This allows the next method in the chain to be called on the same object. If a method does not return self, the chain will break, and subsequent methods cannot be called in the same line.\n",
        "25. What is the purpose of the __call__ method in Python?\n",
        " - The __call__ method in Python enables instances of a class to be called as if they were functions. When an object is \"called\" using parentheses, like instance(), Python automatically invokes the __call__ method defined within the class. This allows for objects to have function-like behavior, encapsulating logic and state within them.\n",
